## Hi I'm Saniya Sirtaz 

🚀 About Me

🎓 I’m Saniya, a 3rd-year B.Tech student in Information Technology at G.L. Bajaj Institute of Technology and Management, Greater Noida, passionate about building scalable and efficient software systems.

💻 With a strong foundation in Core Java, Spring Boot, and REST APIs, I focus on backend development while also working with frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create complete, functional applications.

⚙️ I enjoy designing secure and optimized systems — from database structuring with PostgreSQL/MySQL to implementing authentication, API integrations, and clean architecture principles. My goal is to write code that is not just functional, but maintainable and production-ready.

🛠 I’ve worked on projects like:

🔗 URL Shortener (Spring Boot + JPA + PostgreSQL)

🌱 BeejBank (Digital Seed Bank Platform)

🏨 VacayVision (Hotel Management System)

🧠 Currently, I’m strengthening my Data Structures & Algorithms and diving deeper into backend engineering and system design, preparing myself for high-impact software roles.

🌱 I believe consistency > motivation. Every day is about learning, building, and leveling up.
